"""
This script demonstrates how to use subprocess to create a pipe between two commands.

Assignment:
1. Use subprocess to execute the piped command: 'echo "Hello, pipe!" | wc -w'
2. Capture the output of the second command (wc -w).
3. Print the captured output.

Key concepts:
- Using subprocess.Popen() to create a pipe between commands
- Chaining multiple commands in a subprocess
- Capturing output from a piped command

Note: This example simulates a pipe in the shell, where the output of 'echo' is used as input for 'wc -w'.
