# Clustering Algorithms

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together. This folder contains implementations of various clustering algorithms.

## Algorithms

1. **K-Means**: A centroid-based algorithm that partitions the data into K clusters.
2. **DBSCAN**: A density-based clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed together.
3. **Hierarchical Clustering**: A method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles behind different clustering algorithms
- Implement clustering algorithms from scratch
- Learn how to evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms
- Explore the applications and limitations of each clustering technique

## Assignments

1. Implement the K-Means algorithm (already started in kmeans.py)
2. Create a DBSCAN algorithm implementation in dbscan.py
3. Develop a Hierarchical Clustering algorithm in hierarchical_clustering.py

For each algorithm, focus on:
- Understanding the mathematical foundations
- Implementing the core algorithm logic
- Adding proper documentation and comments
- Creating example usage and visualization of results
