# Supervised Learning Algorithms

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data. This folder contains implementations of various supervised learning algorithms.

## Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression**: A simple approach for predicting a continuous target variable.
2. **Decision Tree**: A tree-like model of decisions for both classification and regression tasks.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles behind different supervised learning algorithms
- Implement supervised learning algorithms from scratch
- Learn how to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate their performance
- Explore the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm

## Assignments

1. Implement Linear Regression in linear_regression.py
2. Create a Decision Tree algorithm in decision_tree.py

For each algorithm, focus on:
- Understanding the mathematical foundations
- Implementing the core algorithm logic
- Adding proper documentation and comments
- Creating example usage and visualization of results
- Implementing appropriate evaluation metrics
