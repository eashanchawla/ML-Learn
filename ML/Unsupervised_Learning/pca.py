Assignment: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Implement the Principal Component Analysis algorithm from scratch. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that finds the directions of maximum variance in high-dimensional data.

Steps to implement:
1. Define the PCA class with a parameter for the number of components
2. Implement the fit method to compute the principal components
3. Create a transform method to project the data onto the principal components
4. Add a method to calculate the explained variance ratio

Requirements:
- Use numpy for efficient computations
- Implement proper error handling and input validation
- Provide clear documentation for each method

Bonus:
- Implement a method to visualize the projected data in 2D or 3D
- Add support for automatic selection of the number of components based on explained variance
