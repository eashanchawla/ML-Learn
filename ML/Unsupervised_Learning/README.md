# Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data. This folder contains implementations of various unsupervised learning algorithms.

## Algorithms

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A dimensionality reduction technique that identifies the axes of maximum variance in high-dimensional data.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles behind different unsupervised learning algorithms
- Implement unsupervised learning algorithms from scratch
- Learn how to preprocess data and evaluate the performance of unsupervised models
- Explore the applications and limitations of each technique

## Assignments

1. Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in pca.py

For each algorithm, focus on:
- Understanding the mathematical foundations
- Implementing the core algorithm logic
- Adding proper documentation and comments
- Creating example usage and visualization of results
