# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. This folder contains implementations of various dimensionality reduction techniques.

## Algorithms

1. **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: A technique for visualizing high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles behind different dimensionality reduction techniques
- Implement dimensionality reduction algorithms from scratch
- Learn how to preprocess data and evaluate the quality of the reduced representations
- Explore the applications and limitations of each technique

## Assignments

1. Implement t-SNE in t_sne.py

For each algorithm, focus on:
- Understanding the mathematical foundations
- Implementing the core algorithm logic
- Adding proper documentation and comments
- Creating example usage and visualization of results
