"""
Assignment: t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

Implement the t-SNE algorithm from scratch. t-SNE is a technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets.

Steps to implement:
1. Define the TSNE class with parameters like perplexity and number of iterations
2. Implement the fit_transform method to compute the low-dimensional representation
3. Create helper methods for computing pairwise affinities and gradients
4. Add a method for optimizing the low-dimensional representation

Requirements:
- Use numpy for efficient computations
- Implement proper error handling and input validation
- Provide clear documentation for each method

Bonus:
- Implement early exaggeration to improve clustering
- Add support for different distance metrics in the high-dimensional space
