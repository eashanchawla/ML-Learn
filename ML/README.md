# Machine Learning Algorithms

This folder contains implementations and explanations of various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience by implementing these algorithms from scratch.

## Folders

1. **Basics**: Fundamental concepts and techniques in machine learning.
2. **Clustering**: Unsupervised learning algorithms for grouping similar data points.
3. **Supervised_Learning**: Algorithms that learn from labeled training data.
4. **Unsupervised_Learning**: Algorithms that find patterns in unlabeled data.
5. **Dimensionality_Reduction**: Techniques for reducing the number of features in a dataset.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the mathematical foundations of machine learning algorithms
- Implement popular algorithms from scratch to gain deeper insights
- Learn how to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate their performance
- Explore the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms

Start with the basics and progress through each folder to build a comprehensive understanding of machine learning techniques.
