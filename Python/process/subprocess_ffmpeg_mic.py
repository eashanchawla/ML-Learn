"""
This script demonstrates advanced usage of subprocess with ffmpeg for audio capture and threading.

Assignment:
1. Use subprocess to run ffmpeg and capture audio from a microphone.
2. Create a thread-safe queue to store the captured audio data.
3. Implement a producer that reads from ffmpeg's stdout and puts data into the queue.
4. Implement a consumer that reads from the queue and prints the length of each data chunk.

Key concepts:
- Using subprocess.Popen() for long-running processes
- Working with stdout of a subprocess in real-time
- Implementing producer-consumer pattern with threading.Queue
- Handling continuous data streams

Requirements:
- ffmpeg must be installed on your system
- You may need to adjust the ffmpeg command based on your system's audio setup

Note: This is an advanced task that combines subprocess management, threading, and audio processing concepts.
