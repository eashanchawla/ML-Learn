"""
This script demonstrates how to capture and handle standard error (stderr) output from a subprocess.

Assignment:
1. Use the subprocess module to run the command 'ls /nonexistent_directory'.
2. Capture only the stderr output from this command.
3. Print the captured error output.

Key concepts:
- Using subprocess.run() with specific arguments to capture stderr
- Handling error output from a subprocess
- Understanding how to isolate stderr from stdout

Note: This command is designed to produce an error, as it tries to list a non-existent directory.

# Your code here
# I will instead try to use .popen. It is supposed to be a lower level method to provide more control over how we run, handle outputs from subprocesses
