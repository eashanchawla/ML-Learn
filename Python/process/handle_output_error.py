 Write a Python script that uses the subprocess module to execute an external command.                                                                                                  
 The command should be 'ls -l /nonexistent_directory' (which will fail).                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                        
 - Use subprocess.run() to execute the command.                                                                                                                                         
 - Capture both stdout and stderr.                                                                                                                                                      
 - Print the captured output and error messages.
