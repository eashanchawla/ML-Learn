# Concurrency in Python

This folder contains assignments and examples to help you learn about concurrency in Python, including asyncio, multithreading, multiprocessing, and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

## Assignments

1. **async_web_scraper.py**: Create an asynchronous web scraper using asyncio and aiohttp.
2. **multithreaded_file_processor.py**: Implement a multithreaded file processing system.
3. **multiprocessing_image_resizer.py**: Build an image resizer using multiprocessing.
4. **gil_demonstration.py**: Demonstrate the effects of the Global Interpreter Lock on CPU-bound tasks.
5. **async_vs_threading.py**: Compare the performance of asyncio and threading for I/O-bound tasks.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the differences between concurrency and parallelism
- Learn how to use asyncio for asynchronous programming
- Implement multithreading for I/O-bound tasks
- Utilize multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks
- Gain insight into the Global Interpreter Lock and its impact on Python programs

Complete the assignments in the order listed above for a comprehensive understanding of concurrency in Python.
