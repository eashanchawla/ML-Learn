"""
Assignment: Asynchronous Web Scraper

Create an asynchronous web scraper using asyncio and aiohttp. The scraper should:

1. Accept a list of URLs as input
2. Fetch the content of each URL concurrently
3. Extract and store specific information from each webpage (e.g., title, main content)
4. Save the results to a file

Requirements:
- Use asyncio for managing concurrent requests
- Use aiohttp for making HTTP requests
- Implement proper error handling for failed requests
- Limit the number of concurrent requests to avoid overwhelming the target servers

Bonus:
- Implement a simple rate limiting mechanism
- Add support for parsing different types of web pages (e.g., news articles, product pages)
