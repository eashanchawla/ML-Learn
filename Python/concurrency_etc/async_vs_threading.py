"""
Assignment: Asyncio vs Threading Performance Comparison

Create a program that compares the performance of asyncio and threading for I/O-bound tasks:

1. Implement an I/O-bound task (e.g., making HTTP requests, reading/writing files)
2. Perform the task using asyncio
3. Perform the same task using threading
4. Measure and compare the execution times of both approaches for different numbers of tasks

Requirements:
- Use asyncio for the asynchronous implementation
- Use threading for the multithreaded implementation
- Implement proper error handling for both approaches
- Provide clear performance metrics and analysis of the results

Bonus:
- Experiment with different types of I/O-bound tasks and compare their performance
- Implement a hybrid approach that combines asyncio and threading, and compare its performance
