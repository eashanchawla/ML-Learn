Assignment: Multiprocessing Image Resizer

Build an image resizer using multiprocessing that:

1. Accepts a directory of images as input
2. Resizes each image to a specified dimension
3. Saves the resized images to a new directory
4. Utilizes multiple CPU cores for parallel processing

Requirements:
- Use the multiprocessing module to create and manage processes
- Implement proper error handling for file operations and image processing
- Provide progress updates during the resizing process
- Ensure efficient use of system resources

Bonus:
- Add support for maintaining aspect ratios during resizing
- Implement different resizing algorithms and compare their performance
