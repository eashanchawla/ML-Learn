# Implementing Simple Neural Networks

Watching Andrej Karpathy's refresher on this was awesome! It helped to first watch the lecture, come back to this after a few days, to test how much I had understood. Except for some parts of how to build the computation graph using Digraph the rest of it is built completely without help of the original code.

I built it out like a lecture to myself, building in incremental steps in the jupyter notebook, which resulted in a final package inside the folder micrograd (All credit to Andrej)
