# Learning Repository

This repository is designed for ad-hoc topics that I want to learn and practice. 

- I am writing all the notes myself, and using qwen2.5 or other LLMs to just format them
- I am using LLMs to generate questions/assignments for me to learn more about certain topics

This is done using aider and ollama on my macbook.

## Repository Summary

This comprehensive learning project focuses on various aspects of programming and machine learning:

1. Python Concurrency (Python/concurrency_etc):
   - Covers asyncio, multithreading, multiprocessing, and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
   - Includes assignments for an asynchronous web scraper, multithreaded file processor, multiprocessing image resizer, GIL demonstration, and a comparison of asyncio vs threading

2. Machine Learning (ML):
   - Covers various machine learning algorithms and techniques
   - Subfolders include:
     a. Basics: Fundamental concepts in machine learning
     b. Clustering: Implementations of K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering
     c. Supervised Learning: Linear Regression and Decision Trees
     d. Unsupervised Learning: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
     e. Dimensionality Reduction: t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

The repository aims to provide hands-on learning experiences by implementing these algorithms and concepts from scratch. Each folder contains README files explaining the learning objectives and assignments. The structure encourages a progressive learning approach, starting with basics and moving to more advanced topics.

This project is designed to help learners gain a deep understanding of both concurrent programming in Python and various machine learning algorithms by implementing them manually rather than relying on existing libraries.
